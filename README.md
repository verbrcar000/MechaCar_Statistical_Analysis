## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1) Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. We know this because the p-values for vehicle length and ground clearance are less than 0.05 while the p-values for the other variables are greater than 0.05. This means vehicle length and grounhd clearance do have a significant impact on mpg.

2) The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. If we use the coefficients seen below to generate the formula for the model, we get this:

mpg = 6.27(vehicle length)+.001(vehicle weight)+.07(spoiler angle)+3.55(ground clearance)-3.41(AWD)-0.01

3) The model has an R-squared value of 0.7149. This means that this model can predict mpg with a little more than 71% accuracy. Although clearly not perfect this level of accuract is considered to be relatively effective.
