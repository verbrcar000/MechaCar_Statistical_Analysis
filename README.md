## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
According to the model, vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
We know this because the p-values for vehicle length and ground clearance are less than 0.05 while p-values for the other variables are greater than 0.05.
